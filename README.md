# Professional Portfolio: Advanced CSS Challenge Week 2

## Description

Here I have created an initial portfolio to begin showcasing my work. This will be the version 1.0 if you will. As the course progresses and I learn more and more languages and hone my craft more, I will be adding and updating features as necessary. 

The header showcases my full name in the upper left corner. On the right of the header, there are 3 selectors that represent the different sections of the portfolio page. The links are responsive and will change from white text to black text with a red background when the mouse hovers over them. 

Under the header I was able to add a recent photo of myself. I had some fun looking up all the ways to style an image. I choose greyscale for this particular image as it fit the theme a bit more and a full color image didn't fit it with the rest of the portfolio. I want to learn some more skill regarding photo editing software in the future as I have seen some other portfolios with some very impressive profile images. 

The about me section is very self explanitory currently. I will definitely want to update this section as I actually gain more knowledge and skills so that this is more of a reflection of my professional work and much less personal information. 

The projects section showcases 3 projects that we have done so far in class. The first project needed to be larger than the others per the challenge criteria. I chose to put the Run Buddy webpage in the first section as it looks like the most professional thing I have done over the course of these few weeks and I liked showcasing it. I also added the Rock, Paper, Scissors and Robot Gladiators games. All 3 of these will take you to their respective websites so that anyone can see them in action and even play the games. The other two containers are just place holders for now. All of them will lighten up when the mouse hovers over them in order to alert the user that these are clickable. 

In the contact me section, I was able to access logo images for Instagram, Email, and LinkedIn. These are clickable and will direct the user to my respective pages for the social media sites. The email logo will open their default email and load my email as well. 

I added media queries in order to make the site responsive when on different sized screens. When on a smaller screen such as a smartphone, the layout switched to more columns as opposed to things being inline for a more small screen friendly look.
